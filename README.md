App System Design://
There will be two main components in the system//
1.	Book My Show App //
2.	Theatre Web-App (Serves to provide theatre list and availability)//
BMS app can connect to Theatre API from any device//
Theatre API needs its own server and database to provide its details (could try web scraping BMS or any //external API)//
The App contacts the Theatre API to obtain the details and sync based on the customer selections and //bookings.//
We’ll request the available seats from Theatres API and book using the API’s.//
We will block the tickets based on the IO Request and blocking.//
•	We can follow OS Scheduling Algorithms for the blocking and unblocking requests//
//
Theatre API Requirements: //
•	List of cities//
•	Get Available Seats//
•	Get Show Timings//
•	Block Seats//
•	Unblock Seats//
•	Book Seats//
•	Etc.//
